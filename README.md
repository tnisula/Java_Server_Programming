Instructions for 07-Nokia Java project: 

This project reads nokia financial statistics from the NOK1V-2000-01-01-2014-12-31.csv-file and stores them to the "timo" database table "Kurssit".

Make sure you can connect to jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/07-nokia. Check the instructions from NetBeans IDE tutorial, how to connect to the Java DB. I used GlassFish version 4.1.
